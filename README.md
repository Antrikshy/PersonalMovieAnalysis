PersonalMovieAnalysis
=====================

I have a habit of rating every single movie I watch on IMDb. This repo helps me analyze my IMDb ratings exports while cross-referencing [IMDb's datasets](http://imdb.com/interfaces). You can run it too!

See my detailed write up, with more beginner-friendly instructions for running it on your own data at [film.Antrikshy](http://antrikshy.com/film/analyzing-decades-worth-my-imdb-movie-ratings).

## Dependencies

### Packages

At this time, running this notebook requires:
1. Jupyter
2. Pandas
3. Seaborn

(and all transitive dependencies)

### Others

In addition to packages, the notebook assumes the presence of:
1. An export of a user's ratings.csv, as [generated](https://help.imdb.com/article/imdb/track-movies-tv/ratings-faq/G67Y87TFYYP6TWAV) by IMDb.
2. rackfocus_out.db, as generated by [Rackfocus](https://github.com/Antrikshy/Rackfocus) using [IMDb datasets](http://imdb.com/interfaces).

Both files should be placed in the top-level directory as cloned from this repo.

## Executing

My favorite way to run Jupyter notebooks is using VS Code's [built-in notebook support](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).

Currently, this repo contains one notebook - Analysis.ipynb. In the presence of dependencies listed above, it can be run top-to-bottom as is.
